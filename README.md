## About the Video Course
Have you been worrying that your existing web applications aren't good enough to take advantage of the elasticity of the cloud? Or that refactoring them is going to be very difficult? Azure App Service to the rescue! This course on Azure App Service will offer you the ability to quickly refactor, configure, and deploy your Node.js applications on Azure without breaking a sweat. 

You will benefit from effortless CI/CD configurations and automatic deployments to staging and production environments, and will have more streamlined testing and Quality Assurance processes. Also, you will easily scale your app to meet business needs (while monitoring it for errors and usage statistics with ease) through Azure's services.
